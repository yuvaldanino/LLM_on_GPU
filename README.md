# 🚀 Custom LLM API – Optimized & Self-Hosted AI Model  

## 🔥 Overview  
This project is a **fully self-hosted, optimized AI inference API** that runs a custom **Large Language Model (LLM)** on personal hardware.  
By leveraging **TVM, vLLM, and XLA**, the model is highly efficient, making it a **cost-effective alternative to expensive commercial LLM APIs** like OpenAI's.  

## 🏗 Tech Stack  
- **LLMs** → GPT-2, Phi-1.5 (Fine-tuned)  
- **Optimization** → **TVM** (model compilation), **vLLM** (fast inference), **XLA** (JIT acceleration)  
- **Infrastructure** → **Flask** (API), **Docker** (containerization), **Railway.app** (cloud hosting)  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Fast, optimized AI inference** – Uses **TVM & vLLM** to speed up response times  
✅ **Runs on personal hardware** – Eliminates need for costly OpenAI API  
✅ **Supports model fine-tuning** – Can adapt the LLM for specific use cases  
✅ **Lightweight API** – Exposes a simple **Flask REST API** for easy integration  
✅ **Scalable** – Can be **deployed to cloud GPUs** if needed

## 🛠 Installation & Running the API  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT.git
cd YOUR_PROJECT
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies**  
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the API Locally**
```bash
python server.py
```

### **4️⃣ Test the API**
Send a request to the model via **cURL**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Tell me a fun fact."}'
```
✅ If everything is working, you should see a generated AI response!

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker  
To make deployment easier, you can **run the API in a Docker container**:  

### **1️⃣ Build the Docker Image**  
```bash
docker build -t my-ai-api .
```

### **2️⃣ Run the Container**  
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my-ai-api
```
Now your **AI API is running inside a container!** 🚀

---

## 🌍 Deploying to Cloud (Railway.app)  
If you want to **host the API on the internet**, you can **deploy it to Railway.app**:  

### **1️⃣ Push to GitHub**  
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for AI API"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **2️⃣ Deploy on Railway.app**
1. Go to **[Railway.app](https://railway.app/)**  
2. Create a **New Project** → Select **"Deploy from GitHub"**  
3. Choose your repo and click **"Deploy"**  
4. Once deployed, you'll get a **public API URL** like:  
   ```
   https://your-ai-api.up.railway.app/generate
   ```

✅ **Now your AI API is live and can be accessed from anywhere!** 🎉

## ⚡ AI Optimization Breakdown  
Here’s how this project **makes LLM inference faster & more efficient**:  

| **Optimization** | **What It Does** | **Benefit** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **TVM (Apache TVM)** | Compiles the AI model into highly optimized machine code | **Speeds up inference on CPU/GPU** |
| **vLLM** | Efficient inference engine for large models | **Reduces memory usage & increases throughput** |
| **XLA (JIT Compilation)** | Just-in-time compilation for deep learning workloads | **Faster execution by optimizing tensor computations** |

✅ **These optimizations make the API significantly faster than standard LLM inference!** 🚀
